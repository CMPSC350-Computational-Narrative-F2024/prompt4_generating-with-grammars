## Summary

In this assignment, we're interested in the ways that symbols combine to generate text that engages in meaning-making by employing patterns of semantic sense that we define as "grammar."

Traditionally, this term is used to both connote and denote agreements of subjects, verbs, objects, and modifiers. Our organic deployment of this concept often differs from canonical "correct grammar," and our explorations of using grammar apparently "incorrectly" can teach us as much about using its as can being "proper" or "correct."

This assignment asks you to construct and observe the effects of grammars for which you can set the rules, albeit in a somewhat more-or-less automated way.

## Goals

* revisit and expand our definition and understanding of "grammar"
* explore new generative techniques that revolve around the use of _corpora_
* supplementing our understanding of the word "source" in our generative computational context
* expanding our repertoire of techniques toward meaning-making through generative processes

## Outcomes

* 2 texts which engage with our new understandings of "grammar":
  * 1 which manually constructs a generative grammar
    * This generative grammar must be based on something _other than_ traditional subject-verb agreement 
  * 1 which uses a Markov chain to combine no fewer than `2` data source texts
    * The source texts must have a common thread -- e.g. all science fiction stories or cookbooks

Each of these pieces should be discussed in an individual [`reflection.md`](writing/reflection.md) document that explores a few questions relating to _both_ pieces and your own comparison of the two.
